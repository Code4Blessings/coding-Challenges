# Coding Challenges
This is a collection of my coding challenges which are either in progress or complete. These challenges are all coded in python.

### Methods and Built-in Functions
In this directory, there will be exercises completed using different python methods and built-in functions.  These include list comprehension and dictionary exercises.

### Data Structures and Algorithms 
This includes Hash Tables 
- Linked Lists
- Graphs
